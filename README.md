# Tic-Tac-Toe
Python Tic-Tac-Toe terminal game

Example exercise of a Python script to play tic-tac-toe in the terminal. Note that as this was written as a learning exercise in Python coding, it does not follow many of the conventions outlined in PEP 8.

The code does not currently support any sort of game analysis or strategy for the computer player - computer moves are randomly selected from a list of legal spaces. Future versions of the program may include this feature, which would be a worthy learning exercise before tackling more advanced applications.
